### Hey, Bona here 👋  
**Software Engineer • FinTech Enthusiast • Homelab Enthusiast • Amazed by cool problems**

---

I design and build software that aims a little higher than the ordinary—systems that scale, systems that adapt, and systems that *matter*.  
My curiosity gravitates toward financial technology, distributed systems, efficient architecture, and everything that nudges the world toward smarter, more humane infrastructure.

🔹 **Currently @ Deel** — building global payroll and financial systems used worldwide.  
🔹 **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** — cloud-native design, distributed systems, high-availability patterns.  
🔹 **Fan of complex problems** — ledgers, orchestration layers, observability stacks, automation, and homelab experiments.

### 🚀 What I’m exploring right now  
- Financial systems (ledgers, reconciliation flows, automated trading, AI for finances). This is my every day go to.
- Distributed job orchestration and agent frameworks.
- AI-powered developer tools and code-generation pipelines  
- Homelab building, I'm always playing around with my homelab.
